# Financial Analyzer Python Application

## Architecture Overview
Language - Python
Data Processing - Pandas & NumPy
Data Source - yfinance (Yahoo Finance API)
Visualization - Matplotlib

#### Background:
While my previous projects focused on technical analysis and price prediction, I wanted to build a tool dedicated to **fundamental analysis**. The process of manually gathering financial statements (Balance Sheets, Cash Flows, Income Statements) to perform a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is often repetitive and time-consuming.

I developed this application to streamline the valuation process. It automatically pulls historical data, projects future cash flows, and calculates the intrinsic value of a stock. This project was instrumental in learning how to structure financial models programmatically and leverage the Pandas library for complex data manipulation.
