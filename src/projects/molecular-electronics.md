Master's thesis investigating molecular electronics as a path beyond silicon scaling limits.

## The Silicon Challenge

As traditional silicon transistors approach physical limits, molecular electronics offers a promising alternative:
- **Moore's Law Limitations**: Transistor scaling facing quantum effects and heat dissipation issues
- **Economic Constraints**: Exponentially increasing fabrication costs for smaller nodes

## Molecular Electronics Promise

- **Ultimate Miniaturization**: Single/multi-molecule devices at the atomic scale
- **Quantum Properties**: Leveraging quantum mechanical effects for novel functionality
- **Self-Assembly**: Potential for bottom-up manufacturing approaches
- **Material Diversity**: Vast chemical space for device optimization

## Research Focus

The thesis explores how individual molecules can function as electronic components, investigating their potential to overcome the fundamental limitations facing conventional semiconductor technology.
