Master's thesis investigating molecular electronics as a path beyond silicon scaling limits.

The thesis focus is on an alternative to transistor technology. The main research is around the use of asymetric organic molecules that can be used to form diodes and in turn logic circuits.
The biggest issue with this technique is the fabrication methods.
My thesis aimed to explore the use of Helium ion beam microscopy for nano-wire formation and nano-junction formation such that consistent organic molecule deposits could be made to form systems with assymetric electric characteristsis.

## Research Focus

The thesis explores how individual molecules can function as electronic components, investigating their potential to overcome the fundamental limitations facing conventional semiconductor technology.
