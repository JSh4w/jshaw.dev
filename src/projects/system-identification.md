4th year project developing control systems for a soft robotic manipulator using MATLAB and Simulink.

## The Challenge

Soft robots present unique control challenges - their non-linear dynamics and continuous deformation make traditional control approaches ineffective. The project focused on a soft pendulum system.

## Approach

- **System Identification**: Characterizing the system's dynamic behavior from experimental data
- **Model-Based RL**: Using learned models to train controllers in simulation
- **Neural Networks**: Implementing NN-based controllers for handling non-linearities

## Tools

MATLAB, Simulink, reinforcement learning toolboxes
